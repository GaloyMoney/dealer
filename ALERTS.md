# Dealer Alerts

## ðŸš©Dealer is unable to get funds on / off the exchange alert

### Conditions
    in-flight fund (BTC) transfer >0, for >3h (6x 10min = 1h expected on-chain on average)

### Description
- A fund (BTC) transfer has been initiated by the Dealer to either fund a future transaction on the exchange (deposit) or to recover excess collateral (withdrawal)
- The transfer is still pending, after >3h, so apparently not resolve/completed and it's state is uncertain
- Given that the Dealer only currently uses on-chain transactions, it's possible that blocks were very slow and the exchange hasn't released the funds yet which would resolve the transfer
- So the goal of the diagnostic is to figure out the transaction in question using Galoy API via Postman (or other preferred method), it's hash and look if it should have been confirmed already at the exchange and therefore release
    - Do we have on-chain transactions for the active strategy ("OkexPerpetualSwapStrategy")?
    - Are any of those transactions pending?
    - If there are, what does the transaction hash reveal about the number of confirmations on-chain?

#### Diagnostic

1. Postman step 1 (with Dealer creds from GCP/etc): 
    - GraphQL Query:
        ```
            mutation userLogin ($input: UserLoginInput!) {
                userLogin (input: $input) {
                    errors {
                        message
                        path
                    }
                    authToken
                }
            }
        ```

    - GraphQL Variables:
        ```
            {
                "input": {
                "phone": "{{phone}}",
                "code": "{{code}}"
                }
            }
        ```

1. Postman step 2 (with authToken from userLogin in step 1): 
    - GraphQL Query:
        ```
            query me($recentTransactions: Int) {
                me {
                createdAt
                id

                    walletCurrency
                    transactions(last: $recentTransactions) {
                        pageInfo {
                        hasNextPage
                        hasPreviousPage
                        startCursor
                        endCursor
                        }
                        edges {
                        cursor
                        node {

                            settlementAmount
                            settlementFee
                            settlementPrice {
                            base
                            offset
                            currencyUnit
                            formattedAmount
                            }

                            ... on SettlementViaLn {
                                paymentSecret

    - GraphQL Variables:
        ```
            {
                "recentTransactions": 10000
            }
        ```
1. Look for completion of deposits / withdrawals:
    - "memo": "deposit of \<some amount\> btc to OkexPerpetualSwapStrategy",
    - "memo": "withdrawal of \<some amount\> btc from OkexPerpetualSwapStrategy",
    - "status" === "PENDING"?
    - "settlementVia.__typename" === "SettlementViaOnChain"
    - "transactionHash" on btc explorer
    - etc.
			
## ðŸš©Dealer is unable to get liability in USD from Galoy Wallet alert
### Conditions
    liabilityInUsd is not a number (NaN/null/undefined)

### Description
    - The liability in usd figure, coming from the Dealer's Wallet on Galoy is either not a valid number or not received
    - So the goal of the diagnostic is to figure out if the Dealer's USD Wallet is invalid, the endpoint down or else
        - Is the endpoint reachable
        - Is the USD Wallet typename as expected
        - Is the USD Wallet balance a negative number as expected
        - Is the USD Wallet currency as expected

### Checks for on-support

#### Diagnostic

1. Proceed as [above](./ALERTS.md#Dealer-is-unable-to-get-funds-on--off-the-exchange-alert) without transactions data:
    - GraphQL Variables:

            {
                "recentTransactions": 0
            }
        ```
1. Look for UsdWallet and it's balance if call succeed:

### Description

    - So the goal of the diagnostic is to figure out why the Dealer is or seems unable to close down the position and zero the exposure
        - Is the exchange down?

        - Are there any orders being initiated by the Dealer to close down the position?

        - Are there sufficient funds on the exchange to execute the trade and if not
        - Is the exchange down?
        - Are there authentication/other errors on orders sent from the Dealer to the exchange?
